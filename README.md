# Landing-Page-1
HI!
I've been coding for a week and a half and this is my first somewhat professional looking website. I say somewhat because it isn't mobile friendly and isn't very responsive. Other than that it looks good from a visual stand point, still have lots to learn but happy with this first milestone. Hopefully in a few weeks I'll come back and re-do this website with those issues I pointed out above fixed.
